# competitive code test script

## Introduction

This is a script to test your code. This script reads your inputs from `input.txt` and outputs from `output.txt`. Then load and run you whole code from `<file_name>.py` and put your inputs into `input()` function sequentially and assert your answer by answer keys loaded from `output.txt`

## How to Use

- Modify input and output from `input.txt` and `output.txt`. 
- Then run: `python test_app.py -f <your_code_script_path>`. 
  

E.g: `python test_app.py -f app.py`
